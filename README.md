# DM-CherryPicked-Trendlines
On Detecting Cherry-picked Trendlines - Project RevisionData Management Course (2025-2026)📌 Project DescriptionThis project implements the methods proposed in the paper "On Detecting Cherry-picked Trendlines" (Asudeh et al., 2020)2222. The goal is to identify misleading "cherry-picked" claims by calculating a support score—the fraction of alternative trendlines in the data that support the same claim3333.+3We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms on the original weather dataset and apply the detection mechanism to a new domain: Bitcoin Price Trends.🛠 Features & ImplementationAlgorithms:Baseline: A brute-force $O(n^2)$ approach for support calculation4444.+1EXACT_u: An optimized $O(n \log n)$ algorithm using sorted target values and binary search5555.+1Support Metrics: Implementation of the support definition for unconstrained trendlines6.Visualizations: Automated generation of efficiency curves and support distribution charts.📊 Experiments1. Weather Dataset (Reproduction)We replicated the results from the research paper using the Historical Hourly Weather Data7:Efficiency (Fig 8): Compared the runtime of Baseline vs EXACT_u on city-specific temperature data. As expected, EXACT_u scales significantly better as the number of tuples ($n$) increases8888.+1City Support Analysis (Fig 5): Calculated the support for the claim "Summer was colder than winter in 2012"999.+1Vancouver: Found to have the minimum support (< 0.0001)10.Beersheba: Showed the maximum (yet still low) support (~0.1)11.Overall Support: Consistently below 0.018, proving the claim is cherry-picked12.2. Bitcoin/Financial Dataset AnalysisWe applied the EXACT_u algorithm to Bitcoin (BTC) price data to find misleading claims:Case A (The "Fake Rally"): A claim showing a 20% price increase over 3 days, which has a support score of < 0.05 because the broader monthly trend was a sharp decline.Case B (Micro-Trend Distortions): A trendline showing stability during a high-volatility period, masking the actual risk for investors.💻 Tech StackLanguage: PythonLibraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seabornEnvironment: Jupyter Notebook📂 Project StructureProject_code.ipynb: The main notebook containing algorithm implementations and experiments.data/: Directory for datasets (Weather and Bitcoin).results/: Generated graphs (Reproduction of Fig 5, Fig 8, and Bitcoin analysis).
